You can find docs on getting started with Fabulous [here](https://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/Fabulous.XamarinForms/index.html#getting-started). For getting started with F# I recommend this [book](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp) by [Isaac Abraham](https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham) or you can go and visit the [offical Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tour) or [F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/).
